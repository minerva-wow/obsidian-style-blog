# Getting Started with Django

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

## Why Django?

- Ridiculously fast
- Reassuringly secure
- Exceedingly scalable
- Incredibly versatile
- Remarkably mature

## Key Components

1. Models (Database Structure)
2. Views (Logic Layer)
3. Templates (Presentation Layer)
4. URLs (Routing)

Django follows the MVT (Model-View-Template) pattern, which is similar to MVC but tailored for web development.
